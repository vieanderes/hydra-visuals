# Hydra Visuals

Welcome to **Hydra Visuals**, a collection of live‑coded generative art sketches built with [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/). These experiments showcase everything from soft dreamscapes to kaleidoscopic geometry, all running in your browser without any external editor.

## Dependencies & Installation

This project requires Node.js (v14+). It uses Express to serve static files and provide the sketches API.

1. **Initialize npm** in the project root (if you haven’t already):

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
2. **Install Express**:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
3. (Optional) Install **nodemon** for auto‑reloading during development:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev nodemon
   ```

---

## Running Locally

1. Start the server:

   * With Node:

     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   * Or with nodemon (if installed):

     ```bash
     npx nodemon server.js
     ```

2. Open your browser at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

You’ll see a dropdown listing all `.js` sketches, plus a **Reload** button to re‑run the current sketch.

---

## Adding Your Own Sketches

1. Create a new file in `public/sketches/`, e.g. `my-sketch.js`.
2. Write pure Hydra code (ending with `render(o0)` or similar).
3. Save and click **Reload** in the UI (or restart the server) to see it appear.

> **Tip:** No external editor required—just save your `.js` file and switch via the dropdown.

---

## How It Works

* **server.js** uses Express to serve everything in `public/` and exposes `/sketches` to list all `.js` files.
* **index.html** fetches that list, populates a `<select>`, and uses `eval()` to load the selected sketch.
* The Hydra canvas is created at full window size and accounts for high-DPI screens.

---

## Usage Tips

* Press **Reload** after editing a sketch file to see your updates instantly.
* Load a sketch by default via URL:
  `http://localhost:3000/?sketch=cool-wave.js`
* Host on GitHub Pages by pointing Pages to the `public/` folder.
